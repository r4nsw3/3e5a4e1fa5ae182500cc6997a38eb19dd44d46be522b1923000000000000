  |   Rad is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too      |
  |   many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night    |
  |   of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned       |
  |   itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his    |
  |   TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game        |
  |   adventure.                                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Dusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game       |
  |   console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he        |
  |   lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and            |
  |   attitude!                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Rad & Dusty's adventure takes them through many dangerous stages of   |
  |   action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This           |
  |   decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and   |
  |   it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the           |
  |   jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the    |
  |   land.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry.   |
  |   The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than    |
  |   enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out   |
  |   a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Sounds & Music: Composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of        |
  |   musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion     |
  |   for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic             |
  |   soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And      |
  |   synthesizers!                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty      |
  |   can enter the electrified Pixelverse - a dangerous                    |
  |   spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty    |
  |   enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the        |
  |   running game world, allowing both Rad & Dusty to continue their       |
  |   journey.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Classic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in   |
  |   sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your          |
  |   precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.                      |
  |                                                                         |
